## Global Sensitivity Analysis

## Objective
To illustrate:
- What Sensitivity Analysis is and what Moment-based AMA indices are
- What information one needs to perform a numerical Sensitivity Analysis via AMA indices
- What additional products you can get with the information required for SA
- Example 1 - Ishigami Function
- Example 2 - Gas flow in low permeable materials (Under construction)

The theory and examples are taken from:
